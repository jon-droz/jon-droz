<b>Hi, Iâ€™m Joanna!</b><br> 
<br>
ðŸŒ± I'm in the process of retraining for IT and exploring my own development path. Currently focused on learning programming and gaining technical skills. Working with code gives me a lot of fun, so I'm strongly convinced that I'm heading in the right direction. <br>
<br>
ðŸŒ± Recently I have been learning <b>Javascript</b> and improving my front-end skills as well as developing towards quality assurance and <b>manual/automation testing</b>.<br> 
<br>
ðŸŒ± At this point I would like to gain competences of an automation tester.<br>
